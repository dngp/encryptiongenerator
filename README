In this project the developed software is a programme that takes as input a
certain message in text, then applies an encryption algorithm and outputs 
the encrypted message.

codegenerator1.py contains functions for converting a list of characters into
an indexed dictionary, one where the keys are numbers and the other where the
keys are the symbols themselves.

Afterwards the encrypted message may be decrypted back to the original.

The encrypting may be adjusted using certain keys for each algorithm.
At the moment there only exists 1 algorithm.
